# News_Summarization_Agent
A multi-agent system using ADK for personalized newspaper summarization through scraping, grammar correction, and content condensation.

# Introduction : 
The News Article Summarizer and Categorizer project is meant to address the issue of information overload in the fast-changing digital world today. It provides an easy-to-use platform that makes consuming news easier as it automatically summarizes news articles from five important categories: India, World, Business, Technology, and Sports. Apart from giving short, easy-to-consume summaries, the website also has a text-to-audio feature, where users can listen to news content while on the move. This is not only making it more accessible to visually impaired readers but also for those who consume more content through audio because of their hectic lifestyle. Through intelligent curation, summarization, and audio output, the project provides a more efficient and inclusive experience of consuming news.

Many readers don’t have the time to go through full articles, and relying solely on the headline and subheading doesn’t provide a complete understanding of the key points covered. Since it’s not feasible for news outlets to create summaries for every piece they publish, incorporating built-in article summarization features in news apps could be a practical solution.

#  *Tools & Technologies Used* :   
* Python
* Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) [framework] 
* Google Gemini (via google.generativeai) 
* Google Custom Search API

## Environment Setup: 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This command is to create an isolated Python environment named '.venv' to manage project-specific dependencies separately:  
> ```bash
> python -m venv .venv
> ```

To activate the '.venv' virtual environment:  
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```
  create a requirements.txt file with all necessary packages:
  ```bash
  requests
  google-generativeai
  google-adk
  python-dotenv  #  if using .env support only
  ```
We install all necessary project dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt: 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Steps to  Create the Project Folder Structure

1. **Create a main project folder** named `GADK`(or anyother name of your choice).

2. Inside the `GADK` folder, **create a subfolder** named `mta`.

3. Inside the `mta` folder, create the following **files**:

   * `__init__.py`

   * `agent.py`

   * `.env`

   >  In VS Code: Right-click the `mta` folder → click **"New File"** → enter the file name → press `Enter`.

4. When you're done , The folder structure should now look like this:

   ```
   GADK/
   └── mta/
       ├── __init__.py
       ├── agent.py
       ├── .env
       └── __pycache__/     # (This will appear automatically after running Python code)
   ```

>[!NOTE]
>The `__pycache__` folder is automatically generated by Python when you run your scripts. You do **not** need to create it manually.


### Root agent
The root_agent of the agent.py has a specific structure to be followed : 
Here are parameters to be defined in the root_agent <br/>
```name```
* Purpose: Sets a unique identifier or label for the agent.
* Used internally for tracking, logging, or referencing the agent in a larger system.
  
```model```
* Purpose: Specifies which large language model the agent uses for its reasoning or text generation.
* Usage: The core brain of the agent.

 ```description```
* Purpose: A human-readable summary of what the agent does.
* Usage: Helps developers, interfaces, or debugging tools understand the agent’s purpose.

```instruction```
* Purpose: Provides the prompt-level behavior guidance for the model. Think of this as the system prompt.
* Usage: Guides how the model should behave when generating responses.

```tools```
* Purpose: Defines which external tools or functions the agent can call.
* Usage: These might include APIs, web search tools, or custom Python functions.

## Agent.py

The agent.py can be modified according to the use case that the developer needs, and based on that, the functions are to be defined. Here, we have the following functions: summarize_news,correct_grammar,fetch_news,summarize_news_from_query. The search agent here makes use of Google Search to assist the Gemini LLM, which runs offline locally. We need to make a connection to the Google Custom Search Engine (CSE) by using Google Cloud systems. The options must be explored carefully. To be able to make use of the advanced resources, you need to create a billing account.

Clear instructions to link the API key and create the CSE have been specified in the CSE_101.txt file.
> [!CAUTION]
> DO NOT forget to replace the api-keys (mentioned with ***** for easier identification ) 

# Project Overview: 
This project revolves around Content Creation utilizing the Agent Development Kit (ADK) and implements multiple agents. We have decisively chosen Newspaper Summarization as our focus area. In this project, various agents collaboratively execute essential tasks, including scraping news articles, correcting grammar, summarizing content, and presenting information based on user inputs such as state, country, and language.
